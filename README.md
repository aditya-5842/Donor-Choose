# Donor_Choose
I'm applying various machine-learning algorithms on donor-choose data set. The file "EDA_TSNE.ipynb" contains exploratory-data-analysi and T-SNE plots. T-SNE plots are used to visualize high dimension data into lower dimension data. 
Other files are name as "model_name.ipynb". Here "model_name" can be k-NN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, support vector machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.
